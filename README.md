## Hey there, Beautiful Media Hoarders! üëã

So you've got a Plex server stuffed with more cinematic gold and TV trash, than a Blockbuster from 2003 (RIP, sweet prince), and you want to know what the hell you actually have? Well buckle up, buttercup! This isn't just another boring README written by some code monkey who thinks "fun" is a variable name.

This is a comprehensive collection of Python scripts that'll export your Plex content into Excel reports so detailed, they'd make the IRS weep tears of joy. We're talking movie catalogs, TV show completeness tracking, and enough color-coding to make a rainbow jealous.

## üéûÔ∏è What Is This Sorcery?

Meet your new best frenemy: a trio of Python-powered bad boys that rip your Plex library a new spreadsheet.

- [**Plex Media Export**](https://github.com/PrimePoobah/PlexScripts/tree/main/Plex%20Media%20Export%20to%20Excel): The Swiss Army Chainsaw of Excel reports. Movies AND TV shows. Together. Harmony.
- [**Movie Exporter**](https://github.com/PrimePoobah/PlexScripts/tree/main/Plex%20Movie%20List%20Export%20to%20Excel): Just movies. Just the facts. Just justice.
- [**TV Show Audit Tool**](https://github.com/PrimePoobah/PlexScripts/tree/main/Plex%20TV%20Show%20Export%20to%20Excel): Completion stats, TVMaze brainpower, and a color-coded guilt trip for your binge-watching sins.

## üß† Features That Punch Mediocrity in the Face

### üé¨ For Movie Maniacs (Or: "How Many Times Did I Buy The Same Movie?")
- Complete inventory because you probably forgot you own Green Lantern (we don't talk about Green Lantern)
- Resolution-based highlighting that'll shame you for your 480p collection
- Technical details for the nerds (you know who you are)
- Content metadata so you can remember why you bought Cats (spoiler: there's no good reason)
- Customizable fields via .env because I'm not your mom ‚Äì configure it yourself
- Alphabetical sorting because chaos is only fun in combat
- It's like IMDB got Excel-itis.

### üì∫ TV Show Tracking (Or: "The 'Do I Actually Have All the Episodes?'")
- Finds missing episodes you didn't know you were avoiding.
- Series completion tracking with TVMaze integration (because manual counting is for psychopaths)
- Season-by-season breakdown that's more detailed than my therapy sessions
- Color-coded status indicators:
  - üü© Green: Complete (like my collection of regrets)
  - üü• Red: Incomplete (like my understanding of healthy relationships)
  - ‚¨õ Gray: This never existed (Like my social life)

### üí• Advanced Features (Because We're Fancy Like That)
- Multi-threaded processing (faster than my mouth in a fight)
- Environment variables from .env files (because hardcoding is what killed the dinosaurs)
- Memory-optimized Excel generation (won't crash your potato computer)
- Cached TVMaze lookups (because API rate limits are the real enemy)
- Progress reporting more detailed than my therapy notes
- Handles errors like an emotionally mature adult. (Not me.)
- Sortable Excel tables (organization is my middle name... actually it's Winston, but whatever)

## üöÄ Installation Instructions (or ‚ÄúHow to Not Screw It Up‚Äù)

### üß∞ Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- Plex server (not imaginary)
- Plex token (like a golden key but nerdier)
- Internet (for TVMaze, not for my OnlyFans)

### üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Summon the Tools

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PrimePoobah/plex-media-export.git
cd plex-media-export
pip install plexapi pandas openpyxl requests python-dotenv
cp .env.example .env
nano .env  # Or edit in Notepad if you're stuck in 2005
```

**Configure your settings (this is where the magic happens):**
```
PLEX_URL="http://{Your_Plex_IP}:32400"
PLEX_TOKEN="{YourSuperSecretPlexToken}"
PLEX_EXPORT_DIR="{WhereYouWantYourFiles}"
PLEX_MOVIE_EXPORT_FIELDS="Title,Year,Studio,ContentRating,Video Resolution,File Path,Container,Duration (min)"
PLEX_SHOW_EXPORT_FIELDS="Title,Year,Studio,ContentRating"
```

### üéüÔ∏è PLEX_TOKEN Hunt
1. Log into Plex web interface (you know, that thing you use to procrastinate)
2. Play any media file (I suggest *Deadpool*)
3. Click the three dots (‚ãÆ) because apparently we're all ancient Greeks now
4. Select "Get Info" (getting philosophical, are we?)
5. Click "View XML" (now we're speaking in tongues)
6. Find "X-Plex-Token" in the URL (congratulations, you're now a hacker)

## üéØ Running the Scripts

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ The Big Kahuna

This script does everything. It's like the Swiss Army knife of Plex tools, if Swiss Army knives could judge your media collection.

```bash
python PlexMediaExport.py
```
Output: `PlexMediaExport_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.xlsx`
*Because timestamps are like signatures ‚Äì they prove you were here*
Contains both:
- **Movies** tab
- **TV Shows** tab (with Maze magic)

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Just the Movies, Ma‚Äôam

For when you only care about movies. It's focused, dedicated, and probably has commitment issues.

```bash
python plex_movie_export.py
```
Output: `plex_movies.xlsx`
*Simple name for simple people*

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Show Me the TV

This one tracks TV show completion like a particularly obsessive stalker.

```bash
python plex_tv_shows.py
```
Output: `plex_tv_shows_YYYYMMDD.xlsx`

*With a timestamp because even TV shows deserve to know when they were cataloged*

## ‚ùìFAQ (Freakin‚Äô Awesome Questions)

### Q: Will this work on a headless server?
**A:** Yes, unlike me, these scripts don't need a pretty face to function.

### Q: Will this mess up my Plex library?
**A:** Nope, it's read-only. Less invasive than a wellness check.

### Q: How often should I run these?
**A:** Depends how often you add stuff. Weekly if you're obsessive, monthly if you have a life.

### Q: Can I customize the colors?
**A:** Sure, dive into the code and make it fabulous. Rainbow everything if you want.

### Q: Why don't some shows appear?
**A:** Because Plex and TVMaze sometimes disagree more than a married couple on vacation.

### Q: Where do the files go?
**A:** Same folder as the script, unless you specify otherwise. It's not hide-and-seek.

Now go! Export that media like the spreadsheet superhero you were born to be.

*P.S. - If you're reading this far, you either really need this tool or you have way too much time on your hands. Either way, welcome to the club.*

*P.P.S. - No, I won't help you organize your actual physical media. That's what fire is for.*
