# Example .env file for Plex Media Export Script
#
# How to use:
# 1. Rename this file to .env (remove the .example part)
# 2. Fill in your actual Plex URL and Token below.
# 3. Ensure you have a library like 'python-dotenv' installed if you want your
#    Python script to automatically load these variables from this file when it starts.
#    If you don't use python-dotenv, you'll need to source this file in your shell
#    before running the script (e.g., `export $(grep -v '^#' .env | xargs)` on Linux/macOS)
#    or set the environment variables manually. The current Python script in the Canvas
#    relies on the environment variables being already set in the environment it runs in.

# Your Plex server URL (e.g., http://localhost:32400 or https://yourplex.domain.com)
PLEX_URL="http://YOUR_PLEX_IP_OR_DOMAIN:32400"

# Your Plex X-Plex-Token
# You can find this by following instructions here:
# https://support.plex.tv/articles/204059436-finding-an-authentication-token-x-plex-token/
PLEX_TOKEN="YOUR_X_PLEX_TOKEN_HERE"

# Optional: Specify a directory where the Excel export should be saved.
# If commented out or not set, the script will save the export in the
# directory where it is run.
# Example for Windows: PLEX_EXPORT_DIR="C:\Users\YourUser\Documents\PlexExports"
# Example for Linux/macOS: PLEX_EXPORT_DIR="/home/youruser/plex_exports"
# PLEX_EXPORT_DIR=""
